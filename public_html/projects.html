            <h4> Portfolio 1</h4>
            <p> In project 1 we are learning how to make a website and the basic programs of making a website. 
                We learned how to link, screenshot and how to code correctly.</p>
            <h4> Portfolio 2 </h4>
            <p> In portfolio 2 we're learning about how to use rows, columns and containers in a code. 
                We're also learning how to use bootstrap as our program. </p>
            <h4> Snake </h4>
            <p> Snake was our third project and first game we learned how to make. Snake to me was one of our hardest projects, I think it will always be considering it was our first game project and first time using javascript.  </p>
            <h4> Mario </h4>
            <p> Mario was our fourth and final game/project of the first semester. Mario was way more fun then snake for me, I just believe it was way easier.</p>
